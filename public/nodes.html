<h2>Choose Your Node Adventure</h2>

<p>
  Adventure gamebooks, like the <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> series or <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> books, are written as
  a series of individual sections which, if read in sequentially, seem janky and out of sequence. Each section is a
  scene in the narrative that YOU, the reader, are currently playing out. At the end of each scene you are presented
  with a list of choices for the next section to read, representing the consequences of the action described and/or the
  reactions you can make in response to it. When read as intended, from the first section then choosing your path,
  an interactive narrative unfolds where YOU are the hero. You succeed or fail based on your actions; the story is
  decided by you.
</p>

<p>
  This format is not limited to pen &amp; paper. Most narrative video games; RPGs; Adventure Games; Storybooks etc
  operate on the same basis, albeit in a more complicated form. Nor is it confined to gaming; there are interactive
  short stories like <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i> by Jorge Luis Borges; programmed learning materials like the 
  <i>TutorText</i> series and many more riffs on this idea.
</p>

<p>
  In their simplest form, like a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i>, you only ever make choices. Gamebooks spice things
  up by adding RPG mechanics into the mix; allowing you to collect treasure; fight monsters and test your skill and 
  luck. The mechanics can be simple and limited to just one book or adventure, like in the <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> 
  series, or span multiple books creating a long form campaign like in the <i>Lone Wolf</i> series.
</p>

<p>
  These kinds of books reached their peak of popularity in the 80's, after which computers had caught up and were able
  to render these kinds of adventures not just a bare console text, but with actual graphics and mechanics that you 
  didn't have to keep track of yourself. There has been a slight comeback, with new titles added to the 
  <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> series in the last few years, but their moment has gone; the idea behind them, however,
  lives on in the form of hypertext.
</p>

<p>
  A basic website works, in some ways, like a gamebook. The user navigates the website like an adventurer delving the
  depths of <i>Deathtrap Dungeon</i>; instead of fighting mosters and overcoming traps, they have to contend with 
  adverts cookie policies. Each page of a website contains text and links to other pages, just like how each section in
  a gamebook contains links to different sections. The similarity is not due to the author stretching a metaphor beyond
  its limits. In computer science, a web page or section in a gamebook is known as a node, and the gamebook or site 
  itself comprises a graph.
</p>


<h3>Graph Theory in Adventure Books</h3>

<p>
  In computer science terms, a directed graph (or digraph) consists of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vertices (nodes)</strong>: The individual locations or states in the system</li>
  <li><strong>Edges (connections)</strong>: The relationships or transitions between nodes</li>
  <li><strong>Direction</strong>: The permitted flow from one node to another</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Adventure gamebooks typically implement a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to prevent infinite loops, though some may
  include cycles for specific gameplay mechanics. The reader traverses this graph through decision-making, performing
  what amounts to a depth-first search through the narrative space.

<h3>Implementing an Adventure Node System</h3>

<p>
  Let's implement a simple Choose Your Own Adventure system using TypeScript:

<pre><code class="language-typescript">interface AdventureNode {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  choices: Choice[];
  isEnding: boolean;
}

interface Choice {
  text: string;
  nextNodeId: number;
}

class AdventureGraph {
  private nodes: Map&lt;number, AdventureNode&gt; = new Map();
  private currentNodeId: number;
  
  constructor(startingNodeId: number) {
    this.currentNodeId = startingNodeId;
  }
  
  addNode(node: AdventureNode): void {
    this.nodes.set(node.id, node);
  }
  
  getCurrentNode(): AdventureNode | undefined {
    return this.nodes.get(this.currentNodeId);
  }
  
  makeChoice(choiceIndex: number): boolean {
    const currentNode = this.getCurrentNode();
    if (!currentNode || choiceIndex &gt;= currentNode.choices.length) {
      return false;
    }
    
    this.currentNodeId = currentNode.choices[choiceIndex].nextNodeId;
    return true;
  }
  
  isAtEnding(): boolean {
    const currentNode = this.getCurrentNode();
    return currentNode ? currentNode.isEnding : false;
  }
  
  // Validate that all choices lead to valid nodes
  validateGraph(): boolean {
    for (const node of this.nodes.values()) {
      for (const choice of node.choices) {
        if (!this.nodes.has(choice.nextNodeId)) {
          console.error(`Node ${node.id} has invalid choice to ${choice.nextNodeId}`);
          return false;
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Five Room Dungeon Example</h3>

<p>
  To illustrate this concept, let's create a simple five-room dungeon adventure using our node system. First, let's
  visualize the structure using a Mermaid diagram:
</p>

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
  A[1: Entrance: Guardian Goblin]
  A -->|"Fight"| B
  A -->|"Sneak past"| B
  A -->|"Bribe"| B

  B[2: Puzzle Room]
  B -->|"Solve riddle"| C
  B -->|"Break mechanism"| E

  C[3: Treasure Room]
  C -->|"Take treasure"| D
  C -->|"Leave treasure"| E

  D[4: Trap Room]
  D -->|"Disarm trap"| E
  D -->|"Triggered trap"| F

  E[5: Boss Chamber]
  E -->|"Fight dragon"| G
  E -->|"Flee dungeon"| H

  F[Ending: Death]
  G[Ending: Victory]
  H[Ending: Escape]
</div>

<p>
  Now, let's implement this adventure using our node system:
</p>

<details>
  <summary>Click to view the code</summary>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">// Create the adventure
const dungeon = new AdventureGraph(1);

// Add the nodes
dungeon.addNode({
  id: 1,
  text: &quot;You stand at the entrance of the dungeon. A goblin guards the doorway, eyeing you suspiciously.&quot;,
  choices: [
    { text: &quot;Attack the goblin&quot;, nextNodeId: 2 },
    { text: &quot;Try to sneak past while it's distracted&quot;, nextNodeId: 2 },
    { text: &quot;Offer gold to pass&quot;, nextNodeId: 2 }
  ],
  isEnding: false
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 2,
  text: &quot;You enter a chamber with a stone pedestal in the center. There's a riddle inscribed: 'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind.'&quot;,
  choices: [
    { text: &quot;Answer 'Echo'&quot;, nextNodeId: 3 },
    { text: &quot;Smash the pedestal&quot;, nextNodeId: 5 }
  ],
  isEnding: false
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 3,
  text: &quot;The pedestal slides away, revealing a hidden compartment with a glittering treasure chest.&quot;,
  choices: [
    { text: &quot;Take the treasure&quot;, nextNodeId: 4 },
    { text: &quot;Leave it and proceed&quot;, nextNodeId: 5 }
  ],
  isEnding: false
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 4,
  text: &quot;As you lift the treasure, you hear a click. The floor beneath you begins to crumble, revealing spikes!&quot;,
  choices: [
    { text: &quot;Try to disarm the trap&quot;, nextNodeId: 5 },
    { text: &quot;Jump but fail to escape&quot;, nextNodeId: 6 }
  ],
  isEnding: false
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 5,
  text: &quot;You enter a massive chamber with ancient columns. A dragon sleeps on a pile of gold in the center.&quot;,
  choices: [
    { text: &quot;Fight the dragon&quot;, nextNodeId: 7 },
    { text: &quot;Flee the dungeon&quot;, nextNodeId: 8 }
  ],
  isEnding: false
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 6,
  text: &quot;The spikes impale you. Your adventure ends here.&quot;,
  choices: [],
  isEnding: true
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 7,
  text: &quot;After a fierce battle, you defeat the dragon and claim its hoard. You are victorious!&quot;,
  choices: [],
  isEnding: true
});

dungeon.addNode({
  id: 8,
  text: &quot;You escape the dungeon with your life, if not your pride. Perhaps another day you'll return better prepared.&quot;,
  choices: [],
  isEnding: true
});

// Validate the graph
if (dungeon.validateGraph()) {
  console.log(&quot;Adventure is ready to play!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
</details>

<p>
  This implementation demonstrates how adventure books structure their narratives as traversable graphs. Each choice
  represents an edge leading to another node, and the reader's decisions determine their path through the story. The
  same approach is used in digital RPGs, interactive fiction, and even modern narrative-heavy video games.
</p>

<p>
  From a computational perspective, this structure offers several advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Modularity</strong>: Each node can be designed independently</li>
  <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Multiple paths can lead to the same node</li>
  <li><strong>Analyzability</strong>: The narrative structure can be validated programmatically</li>
  <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: New nodes and paths can be added without disrupting existing ones</li>
</ul>
