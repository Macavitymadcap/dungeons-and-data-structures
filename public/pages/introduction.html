<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Role-playing games (RPGs) and tabletop systems like Dungeons &amp; Dragons have evolved alongside computer science
  over the decades, and the overlap between these domains is both fascinating and instructive. At their core, both RPGs
  and software development rely on structured information and rules for manipulating that information—the very
  definition of algorithms and data structures.

<p>
  Data structures in computer science are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and accessing data efficiently.
  From simple arrays and linked lists to complex graphs and trees, these structures provide the foundation upon which
  software is built. Similarly, RPGs employ their own specialized data structures: character sheets organize player
  abilities, monster stat blocks standardize enemy capabilities, and adventure modules structure narrative progression.

  Algorithms, meanwhile, represent the step-by-step procedures for solving problems. In software, algorithms handle
  everything from sorting data to pathfinding in virtual worlds. In RPGs, algorithms determine how damage is calculated,
  how characters advance, and how the probability of success is determined through dice mechanics.

  This essay explores the parallels between RPG systems and computer science principles, demonstrating how the design
  patterns found in games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and adventure gamebooks can inform software architecture—and vice
  versa. We'll examine branching narrative structures, stat block abstraction, character composition models, and more,
  illustrating these concepts with TypeScript code examples and diagrams.

  By viewing RPGs through the lens of computer science, we gain insights not only into more effective game design but
  also into more intuitive software architecture that models real-world systems and narratives.
