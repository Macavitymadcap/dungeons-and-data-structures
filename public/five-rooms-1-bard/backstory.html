    Like many bad situations in life, it all started with a drink; a drunken argument to defend your honour, what 
    little you have. You are a bard, not exactly known for fighting prowess or brave exploits. You hop from tavern
    to inn (and the occasional brothel when the madam's feeling particularly bored), trying to make ends meet by 
    singing the songs that every one knows.
    </p>

    <p>
    And that was the problem. You were doing your usual set down at the <i>Hope &amp; Ankheg</i>, even scrapping
    together a few copper in tips, when a loud-mouthed adventurer starts heckling you. "We've heard that crap a
    thousand times. Play something new. Tell us something you've done!"
    </p>

    <p>
    You try to ignore him, but the crowd is egging him on. "Yeah, tell us about your adventures. What have you
    done? What have you seen?" You try to change the subject, but the adventurer is relentless. "You think you're
    so clever, don't you? You think you're so special. But you're just a bard - a glorified storyteller!"
    </p>

    <p>
    That was the final straw. You threw down your lute and stared the adventurer in the eye, saying: "Fine, you want
    a story? I'll give you a story. I'll show you what I've done. I'll show you what I can do." You stormed out of
    the tavern, leaving the crowd in stunned silence. You were going to show them. You were going to show them
    all. You were going to show them what a bard could do.
    </p>

    <p>
    You walked around town, deciding what kind of adventure to have when it stumbled into your lap. Outside the
    town hall, a board lists bounties and jobs dictated by the Baroness. One of the posts jumped out at you:
    </p>

    <p class="written">
    A tribe of goblins has infested the caves under Mt. Avreil. Though they are few now, if they grow in number 
    as their kind are like to do, the pose a a serious threat to he Grace's domain. The Baroness offers 500 gold to
    anyone who can show that the goblins have been removed, by any means necessary, from her environs. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Goblins - small potatoes, and only a tribe - that's like less than 10 or something right? Anyone can handle a 
    handful of goblins. You ripped the notice from the board and headed for the north gate out of town toward Mt. 
    Avreil.
    </p>
