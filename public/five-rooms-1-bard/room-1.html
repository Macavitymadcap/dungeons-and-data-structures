        The road from town to Mt. Avreil is well-trodden, and you make good time. The sun is setting behind the 
        mountain, and the shadows grow long as you approach the entrance to the caves. Just outside the mouth you see a
        lone goblin, sitting on a rock facing to the east and a sharpening a shortsword. They don't seem to have 
        noticed you, seemingly lost in the whetstone.
    </p>

    <p> What do you do?</p>
