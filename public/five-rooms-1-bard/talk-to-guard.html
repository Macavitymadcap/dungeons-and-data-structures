    <p>
        As you approach the goblin sitting on the rock, you notice that they are wearing 
        a tattered leather vest and a pair of ragged shorts. They have a small dagger 
        strapped to their belt, and their hair is matted and dirty. The goblin looks up at
        you with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. 
    </p>

    <p>
        What do you do?
